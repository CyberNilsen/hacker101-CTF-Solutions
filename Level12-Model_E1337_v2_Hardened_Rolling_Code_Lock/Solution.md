# Model E1337 - Rolling Code Lock Challenges

**Difficulty:** Expert  
**Category:** Math  
**Flags:** 0/1  
**Status:** Not Attempted (Research Only)

## üß† Overview

The Model E1337 Rolling Code Lock challenges are math-intensive CTF problems that involve cracking Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs). There are two versions:

1. **Model E1337 v1** - Basic rolling code lock
2. **Model E1337 v2** - Hardened version with additional security measures

## üîç Challenge Description

Both challenges present an input field where you must enter a number that matches the next output generated by a PRNG. When an incorrect number is entered, the system shows an error message revealing the expected value.

**Key Differences:**
- **v1**: Generates 26-bit numbers, uses 32-bit seed
- **v2**: Generates 64-bit numbers, supposedly uses 64-bit seed (but has a critical bug)

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution Approaches

### Method 1: Symbolic Execution (v1 Only)
The writeup demonstrates using **z3-solver** (SMT solver) to solve the PRNG mathematically:

```python
# Constraints for z3-solver:
# - PRNG seed must be ‚â•0, ‚â§0xFFFFFFFF
# - First 26 bits must match error message
# - Include second consecutive value for accuracy
```

**Runtime:** ~5 seconds on a decent workstation

### Method 2: Computational Brute Force (v2)
For the hardened version, the author discovered a critical vulnerability:

**üêõ Bug in v2:** Despite claiming 64-bit security, only the rightmost 32 bits of the seed are actually used, reducing the keyspace from 2^64 to 2^32.

**Optimization Strategy:**
1. **Vector-based operations** using NumPy
2. **GPU acceleration** with CuPy 
3. **Smart filtering** - First check 8-bit matches, then full 64-bit validation

**Performance Improvements:**
- Linear approach: 22 seconds for 100k operations
- Parallel (8 cores): 7 seconds
- Vector-based: 0.4 seconds  
- GPU-accelerated: 1.96 seconds for 1M operations

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Estimates

**For v2 brute force:**
- **Theoretical:** ~2.34 hours to cover full 32-bit space
- **Actual runtime:** 106 minutes (1 hour 46 minutes)

## üéØ Why I Didn't Attempt

This challenge requires:
- **Advanced mathematical knowledge** of PRNG algorithms
- **Significant computational resources** (GPU acceleration helpful)
- **2+ hours of runtime** for the brute force approach
- **Complex optimization techniques** for feasible solving

The mathematical complexity and time investment made this challenge impractical for my current skill level and available time.
